pyFosCamGui
===========

GUI to control Foscam IPcams

- written in Python3
- based on pyFosControl Interface (https://github.com/MStrecke/pyFosControl)

Introduction
------------

As MStrecke mentioned the Foscam cameras can be controlled via a web interface. The available browser plugins for Firefox,
Chrome and IE are Windows only. This project allows Linux users to control a Foscam camera without usage of a browser.

Getting started
---------------

Create a new `cam.cfg` file using `cam.cfg.example` as template.
Run 'gui.py' from the comand line.
